# Sports Prediction using ML

This repository contains machine learning models for predicting outcomes in various sports, starting with football (French Ligue 1). The project will be extended to other sports such as horse racing (Quint√©, Tierc√©), Formula 1, and more.

## Current Implementations
- **Football (French Ligue 1)**: Predictions based on historical data from the 2023-24 and 2024-25 seasons.
- **Upcoming**:
  - **Horse Racing** (Quint√©, Tierc√©)
  - **Formula 1**
  - **Other team and individual sports**

## üìä Data Sources
- Football match data is collected from available open datasets.
- For other sports, data sources will be specified upon implementation.

##  Machine Learning Approach
- Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature engineering.
- Model selection: Experimenting with logistic regression, random forests, neural networks, and more.
- Performance evaluation: Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and RMSE depending on the sport.

## Installation & Usage
### Requirements
- Python 3.12.9
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `sklearn`, `matplotlib`, `tensorflow` (for deep learning models)
- Jupyter Notebook for running the analyses

### Quickstart
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sports-prediction.git
cd sports-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
